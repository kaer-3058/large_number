#这四条命令是准备工作：
scoreboard objectives add sqrt dummy
scoreboard players set #2 sqrt 2
scoreboard players set #559 sqrt 559
scoreboard players set #32768 sqrt 32768


#把这些命令从上往下输入一条命令方块链里：
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt = sqrt.input sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t1 sqrt = sqrt.input sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t2 sqrt = sqrt.input sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t3 sqrt = sqrt.input sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t4 sqrt = sqrt.input sqrt
scoreboard players test sqrt.input sqrt 0 1515359
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt /= #559 sqrt //条件制约
scoreboard players add sqrt.output sqrt 15 //条件制约
scoreboard players test sqrt.input sqrt 1515360
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt /= #32768 sqrt //条件制约
scoreboard players add sqrt.output sqrt 2456 //条件制约
scoreboard players operation #t1 sqrt /= sqrt.output sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt += #t1 sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt /= #2 sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t2 sqrt /= sqrt.output sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt += #t2 sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt /= #2 sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t3 sqrt /= sqrt.output sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt += #t3 sqrt
scoreboard players operation sqrt.output sqrt /= #2 sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t4 sqrt /= sqrt.output sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t5 sqrt = sqrt.output sqrt
scoreboard players operation #t5 sqrt -= #t4 sqrt
scoreboard players test #t5 sqrt 1
scoreboard players remove sqrt.output sqrt 1 //条件制约


#输入: scoreboard players set sqrt.input sqrt <数值>
#输出: sqrt.output在记分板sqrt上的分数
